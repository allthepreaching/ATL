  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The laws of God can be divided into three main categories: Moral laws,
    Civil laws, and Ceremonial laws.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="intro">
      Moral laws are timeless and have
      existed before Moses delivered the law from Mount Sinai. Moral laws
      are universal in that they apply to all people. These laws reflect the
      holy nature of God.
    </li>
    <li class="intro">
      Civil laws are laws that apply to governments. It
      involves punishment and procedures for them to follow. Nations who
      follow these laws have low crime and high prosperity. They receive
      many blessings from God as recorded in the Scriptures. Nations that
      break these laws will face God’s punishment.
    </li>
    <li class="intro">
      Ceremonial laws are laws
      that foreshadow the finished work that Christ did for us on the cross.
      Christians are not bound by these laws as revealed in many New
      Testament passages.
